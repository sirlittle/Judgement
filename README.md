# Judgement

Judgement is a simple trump based card game. The rules of the game can be found [here](http://card-games.wonderhowto.com/how-to/play-card-game-judgment-0122237/) 

The goal of this project is to provide easy access to anyone who wants to build 
and test an AI to play the game of Judgement. Currently I have created the game
as well as a few straightforward AIs as an example.

I currently want to take this project in the direction of gathering large amount
of statistics from the game itself while simulating the game many thousands of times.
This way, better AIs can be built and also cool bits about the game can be gleaned
such as how much the game is based on luck and how much based on stratergy.

We will be deploying this game to a server somewhere and then allowing folks to build their
bots to compete against each other. All the bot will need to do will be to communicate via 
sending API Calls.

- [X] Complete a working text based game 
- [X] Create a Human Bot to allow user input
- [ ] Make game graphics based rather than text based
- [X] Create simple AI bot templates
- [ ] Pull different stats from the game
- [ ] Analyze stats and make cool graphs
